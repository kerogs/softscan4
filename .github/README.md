## Presentation
KerogsPHP Framework is an easy-to-use PHP framework for websites. Its architecture is simple to understand yet effective. It also provides a good basis for all kinds of projects, especially webapps. It allows you to be autonomous and free in your choices, without being heavy or cumbersome. It also brings with it a certain notion of basic security.

## Installation
1. **Clone the repository**

### requirements
You'll need ``NodeJS`` and ``Composer`` installed.

### Command

```sh
git clone https://github.com/KSInfinite/KerogsPHP-Framework.git
```

2. **Go in the directory**
```sh
cd KerogsPHP-framework
```

3. **Install composer package**
```sh
composer install
```

4. **Go in the public directory**
```sh
cd ./public
```

5. **Install npm package**
```sh
npm install
```

### Docker build && run
```sh
docker compose up --build
```

### Tips for use
#### Use TypeScript
Use this simple command to observe changes made in the file and automatically convert it to JavaScript
```sh
npx tsc --watch
```

#### config.yml
![example config.yml](../.ksinf/configyml_ex.com.svg)

#### .env file
When you log on to the site for the first time, an .env file will be created automatically.

It will contain the database connection information (to be modified as needed), as well as a randomly generated encryption key for later encryption if required. This value can be modified. If you wish, you can modify the ``.env`` file at will. Note that this file will be created automatically each time it is deleted or does not exist.

You can disable automatic generation in the ``config.yml`` file.
example :
```ini
CRYPT_KEY=7927400a-cf78-4977-9a66-36de48d47e09
DB_SERVER=localhost
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=root
