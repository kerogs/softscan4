# Code of Conduct
(CoC v1.0)
## Introduction
Thank you for contributing to this open-source project. This document outlines the expectations and best practices to maintain a collaborative and productive environment. The goal is to ensure that all contributors follow these rules to keep the repository organized and stable.

## Accepted Contributions
Contributors are encouraged to:
- Make adjustments.
- Optimize the code.
- Fix errors (minor or major).
- Add new features.
- Improve performance or documentation.

**However, the repository structure must not be changed.** Any modifications must respect the existing hierarchy and organization.

## Versions and Incrementing
For any accepted contribution:
- **Only modify the value after the dash in the version name**, e.g., `X.Y-shZ`.
- The `sh` value represents the **current snapshot**. Make sure to increment this value by **+1 before submitting a Pull Request (PR)**.
- **If your update is minor, you are not required to change the snapshot.**
- This helps keep track of different versions across multiple platforms (GitHub, Gitea, etc.).

Example:  
Current version: `2.6-sh29`  
New version after contribution: `2.6-sh30`

## Questions or Suggestions
If you have any questions, suggestions, or want to report an issue, please open an **issue** in the repository. The team will review your request and respond promptly.
